FADE IN: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	THE SAME NIGHT

Toby is sitting in a chair throwing his rubber ball against the wall.

MAN [on TV]
That’s an incredible one in 500 Americans afflicted with this disease, which leads me to 
part two of our question.

Toby stops throwing for a moment.

MAN [on TV]
Senator, how is it that, despite the prevalence of this disorder, autism has received 
less than 15 percent...

Paper crumpling.

	TWO NIGHTS LATER

Toby is throwing crumpled legal pad paper into a wastebasket already full with other 
papers. He sighs heavily and throws away another page.

	TWO NIGHTS AFTER THAT

Toby is typing on his laptop. He stops suddenly, looking through the screen and into 
the hallway. He gets up and walks to LEO'S OFFICE.

TOBY
Leo.

LEO
Hey, I didn’t know you were still here.

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
What’s going on?

TOBY
I’ve been thinking... about why Hoynes volunteered to slap down big oil.

LEO
It was his polling information.

TOBY
Yeah, but why did he put the poll in the field at all, is what I’m saying.

LEO
John Hoynes is an egomaniac who needs to be told what people think of him.

TOBY
[chuckles] Well, that’s pretty unusual for Washington.

LEO
Yeah.

TOBY 
[comes closer] Leo, has there been a discussion in some room, some place, anywhere on 
any level about Hoynes being dropped from the ticket in 2002?

LEO
No.

TOBY
You sure?

LEO
Yep.

TOBY
‘Cause I thought maybe it was an Eisenhower-Nixon...

LEO
No, Toby, I wouldn’t give it a lot of thought.

TOBY
Okay. [walks out]

Sound of Toby’s rubber ball hitting the wall.

	THE NEXT NIGHT

FADE IN: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Toby is in his chair, throwing the ball against the wall. Throws with the right hand, 
catches with the left.

	THE NEXT MORNING

FADE IN: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Leo walks in, picks up his mail, walks into his office, and turns on the light. Toby is 
sitting on his couch.

TOBY
Hey.

LEO 
[raises his head, terrified] You scared the hell out of me.

TOBY
The poll that Hoynes put in the field...

LEO
Hoynes is going to run for President one day. Why shouldn’t he do his own polling?

TOBY 
[gets up] He’s going to run for President six years from now, what good does last 
week's do?

LEO
I really don’t know. [walks by him]

TOBY
Okay.

	THAT NIGHT

TOBY [VO]
It’s never happened before, right?

FADE IN: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Toby is pacing in the office.

LEO 
No.

TOBY
A Vice President would never challenge a sitting President for the nomination.

LEO
‘Course not.

TOBY
You see his itinerary for the weekend?

LEO
Who?

TOBY
The Vice President.

LEO
I don’t keep tabs on John.

TOBY
He’s giving a speech at a semiconductor plant. The title of the speech is, "Clean air 
industry in the high-tech Corridor of the Industrial Northeast."

LEO
Where?

TOBY
Nashua. New Hampshire.

Leo takes off his glasses and sits back in the chair. Toby stares at him.

LEO
Toby, nobody, and particularly not Hoynes would be naïve enough... what I mean to say is 
if he’s going to New Hampshire for the reason you’re thinking he would mask it with 
something. It wouldn’t be an official trip. He’d make up a benign excuse to be up there.

TOBY
I know.

LEO
So why are you concerned about the speech?

TOBY
Because it comes in the middle of a three-day camping trip to Killington. [beat] Why does 
Hoynes think the President isn’t going to run again? 

A beat, while the sound of Toby’s ball, slamming into the wall, is heard.

TOBY
What’s going on, Leo? 

Leo doesn’t answer. Toby continues staring at him.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

	THE WEST WING
	11:35 P.M.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet sits at the desk. A knock is heard, and Leo enters.

LEO
Excuse me, Mr. President?

BARTLET
I closed the embassies in Tanzania and Brussels.

LEO
What about domestic?

BARTLET
I don’t have to make that call yet.

LEO
How much time do you have?

BARTLET
About an hour.

LEO
Mr. President, I’ve got Toby waiting in his office right now. 

BARTLET
Why?

LEO
We’ve got to tell him.

BARTLET
Tell him what?

A pause. Bartlet looks at Leo, who gives him a knowing look.

LEO
We’ve got to tell him.

BARTLET
What happened?

LEO
He got curious when Hoynes volunteered to step in for Bill Trotter. And then more 
curious when he found out it was 'cause Hoynes put a poll in the field.

BARTLET
Yeah...

LEO
Now he’s camping in Killington, Vermont, with a quick stop...

BARTLET
Come on!

LEO
...in New Hampshire, and Toby’s not an idiot.

BARTLET
He...

LEO
None of them are.

BARTLET
He scheduled a trip to New Hampshire?

LEO
High-tech corridor of the Northeast.

BARTLET
Yeah, thanks to who?

LEO
What does that matter right now?

Bartlet slams his notebook on the desk.

LEO
I think you got to see this as an opportunity...

BARTLET
To do what?

LEO
To gauge reaction.

BARTLET
You think Toby’s reaction is going to be the same as the public’s?

LEO
I meant the staff.

BARTLET
Which will be?

LEO
I’m sorry, sir?

BARTLET
[rising] The staff’s reaction will be what?

LEO
I don’t know! Shock. Betrayal. Confusion. Concern about our future.

Bartlet nods.

LEO
I don’t know.

BARTLET
What do I tell him?

LEO
Everything.

BARTLET
Go get him.

LEO
Yes, sir.

As Leo leaves, Bartlet lets out a long sigh.

BARTLET
Now it starts.

CUT TO: INT. SAM’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Josh and Sam are sitting in casual clothes, each reviewing the White House 
Correspondents’ Dinner Speech. Josh sighs.

SAM
Hmm...

JOSH
Yes...

SAM
Well...

JOSH
You know what the problem with this is?

SAM
Yes.

JOSH
It’s supposed to be funny.

SAM
And yet...

JOSH
It’s not. 

SAM
No.

JOSH
Who worked on this?

SAM
Jay Breech, Janet Lippman. Andy Kyle worked on it a little.

JOSH
You know what they did?

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
They forgot to bring the funny.

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
How much time do we have?

SAM
I want to show it to him within the hour.

Josh rises and leans into TOBY’S OFFICE.

JOSH
Toby?

TOBY
Yeah?

JOSH
Sam and I are going to stay and punch up some of the jokes from the Correspondents’ 
Dinner.

TOBY
Yeah, I read it.

JOSH
They forgot the funny. 

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
You want to stay?

TOBY
Where are you going to be?

JOSH
We'll find a place.

Leo enters behind Josh.

TOBY
I’ll hook up with you in a little bit.

JOSH
What’s going on?

LEO
Nothing.

JOSH
Okay.

Toby and Leo exit through the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. Josh gives the speech a look just 
as Donna walks by.

DONNA
Hello.

JOSH 
[following her] How you doing? 

DONNA
I’m doing fine.

JOSH
Did you get the flowers?

DONNA
Yes, I did.

JOSH
Did you like ‘em?

DONNA
They were very pretty.

JOSH
Do you know why I sent them?

DONNA
I know why you think you sent them.

JOSH
It’s our anniversary.

DONNA
No, it’s not.

JOSH
I’m the sort of guy who remembers those things.

DONNA
No, you’re the sort of guy who sends a woman flowers to be mean. You’re really the only 
person I’ve ever met who can do that.

JOSH
I’m quite something. 

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
I sent them to mark an occasion.

DONNA
Are we really going to do this every year?

JOSH
For I am a man of occasion.

DONNA
I started working for you in February. This is April, and you’re an idiot.

JOSH
Well, you started working for me once in February and then you stopped for a while.

DONNA
Yes!

JOSH
Then you started working for me again in April. That’s the one I choose to celebrate, 
because it’s the only one where you started working for me and it wasn’t followed by 
your not working but rather going back to your boyfriend, and how, in comparison to 
that and him, you can call me mean is simply another in a long series of...

DONNA
Oh, shut up! Honest to God, do you ever get tired of the sound of your own voice?

JOSH
No. No, no, no. [heads off in an opposite direction]

DONNA
Well, where are you going now?

JOSH
Sam and I are going to punch up the thing for tomorrow. Hey, we need funny people.

DONNA
[anticipating] Yeah?

JOSH
You know any? 

Donna reacts. She goes to her desk.

JOSH
See, right there was a joke. It’s the oldest joke in the book...

DONNA
I'll say.

JOSH
You know what, Ado Annie, I sent you flowers! I think what you’re trying to say is, 
‘Why, thank you, Josh! They’re beautiful! How very thoughtful of you. Not many bosses 
would have been that thoughtful...’

DONNA
Really? 'Cause what I think I was trying to say was ‘Shove it!’

JOSH
Okay, well, then I guessed wrong.

DONNA
Do you want help with the thing?

JOSH
Yes, I do, because you are such an hysterically funny person... did you see how I used 
‘an’ there properly?

DONNA
Yes, I did.

JOSH
You crack me up.

DONNA
You know, there are times, when to put it quite simply, I hate your breathing guts.

JOSH
So the flowers really did the trick, huh?

DONNA
Oh, yeah.

CUT TO: INT. AINSLEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Ainsley is typing at her desk and listening to some type of instrumental music.

SAM [OS]
Ainsley? Ainsley! [enters] Ainsley.

AINSLEY
Hello, Sam.

SAM 
Didn’t you hear me shouting?

AINSLEY
Yes, I did.

SAM
And...?

AINSLEY
I chose to ignore it.

SAM
Because...?

AINSLEY
You were shouting.

SAM
You’re adorable.

AINSLEY
Yet ill-adored.

SAM
Go figure.

AINSLEY
Yeah.

SAM
What are you doing?

AINSLEY
I’m going up to Smith College tomorrow.

SAM
Why?

AINSLEY
It’s my alma mater.

SAM
Reunion?

AINSLEY
No, the women’s studies department is having a panel on resurrecting the ERA.

SAM
Who else is on the panel?

AINSLEY
Rebecca Walker, Gloria Steinem, Anne Coulter, Naomi Wolf...

SAM
You know, something like 40 percent of all women oppose the ERA, and in my entire 
lifetime, I’ve never met one of them.

AINSLEY 
[extending hand] Ainsley Hayes, nice to meet you.

SAM
You’re not...

AINSLEY
Yes.

SAM
You’re not!

AINSLEY
Yes.

SAM
You’re not, you’re not, you’re not one of those people!

AINSLEY
Sam, if, by those people, you’re referring to Episcopalians...

SAM
You’re going back to Smith College, the cradle of feminism, to argue in opposition of 
the Equal Rights Amendment?

AINSLEY
And get some decent pizza, yeah.

SAM
They’re gonna hate you.

AINSLEY
Sam, I’m a straight Republican from North Carolina. You don’t think they hated me the 
first time around?

SAM
Yeah.

AINSLEY
What are you doing?

SAM
I want to punch up some of the jokes for the Correspondents’ Dinner, and I’m looking for 
people left in the building who are funny. I can't find any, so I came to you.

AINSLEY
I would think, Sam, with your infectious sense of humor, you would have no trouble.

SAM
Do you wanna help me or not?

AINSLEY
I need to do this.

SAM
We’ve ordered Chinese food.

AINSLEY
Okay.

Ainsley exits before Sam, and he makes a move as though to swat her with the paper he is 
holding.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo and Toby are waiting. An episode of ‘The Tonight Show’ is playing on one television; 
CNN on the other.

LEO
Did you see the draft for the Correspondents’ Dinner?

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
It’s not funny.

TOBY
Sam’s going to work on it.

A brief pause.

LEO
Toby, take it easy in there, okay?

Charlie enters from the Oval Office.

CHARLIE
You can go in.

Leo and Toby enter THE OVAL OFFICE. Bartlet is making a drink.

TOBY
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Hey, Toby. You want a drink?

TOBY
No, thank you, sir. I'm fine.

BARTLET
Have a drink with me.

TOBY
Sure.

BARTLET
Bourbon, no ice.

Bartlet walks over to give Toby his drink.

TOBY
Thank you.

BARTLET
You know what I just found out recently? To be called "bourbon," it has to come from 
Kentucky. Otherwise it’s called sour mash. An Algerian-born terrorist named Reda Nessam 
was arrested at the Canadian border yesterday with a U-Haul containing ten 2-ounce jars 
filled with nitroglycerin.

TOBY
And they don’t allow that kind of thing at Yosemite?

BARTLET
No. Anyway, on advice from State and Intelligence, I closed the embassies in Tanzania 
and Brussels.

TOBY
What about the FAA?

BARTLET
They want me to order the airports, heighten security, but it’s a holiday weekend. 
I don’t know. Toby, I got to tell you something...

TOBY
Does the FAA have to present evidence of a credible theory?

BARTLET
Yeah.

TOBY
How do they do that?

BARTLET
I don’t know. They do it...

TOBY
Is there... excuse me, sir. Is there a time frame?

BARTLET
About an hour. Toby, around ten years ago, for a period of a few months, I was feeling 
run down and I had a pain in my leg. They both eventually subsided, but then eight 
years ago, the pain came back, as well as numbness. My vision would be blurry sometimes 
and I’d get dizzy. During an eye exam, the doctor detected abnormal pupil responses 
and ordered an MRI. The radiologist found plaque on my brain and spine. I have a 
relapsing-remitting course of MS.

TOBY
I’m sorry, sir?

BARTLET
I have Multiple Sclerosis, Toby.

Toby clears his throat, unable to say anything.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet, Leo, and Toby are sitting quietly.

TOBY
What does "relapsing-remitting" mean?

BARTLET
I'm sorry?

TOBY
What does "relapsing-remitting" mean?

BARTLET
It's... I don't know... it's the good kind of MS.

TOBY
It's the good kind.

BARTLET
Yeah, as opposed to secondary progressive.

TOBY
Which is the bad kind.

BARTLET
Yeah. MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms can be as mild as 
numbness or as severe as paralysis.

TOBY
And loss of vision?

BARTLET
Yeah.

TOBY
Cognitive function?

BARTLET
Yup.

TOBY
Is it... I'm sorry, is it fatal?

BARTLET
No. That's the good news. The bad news is there's no cure.

TOBY
Yeah, that I knew. [beat] Does relapsing...

BARTLET
Ever turn into secondary progressive?

TOBY
Yeah.

BARTLET
Sure.

TOBY
Is there any way of telling if it's going to?

BARTLET
No.

TOBY
Okay.

Toby stands up, rubbing his head.

TOBY
[beat] I'd like to stand up. Can I stand?

BARTLET
Yeah.

A knock on the door. Charlie enters. Leo raises a finger as a 'wait' signal.

TOBY
I'm sorry, sir, uh... I need to... Can I, uh... Excuse me.

Toby walks out to the portico.

CHARLIE
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah.

CHARLIE
You wanted the call from Mr. Garreth at the FAA.

LEO
Charlie, could you put it through to my office?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir. [exits]

LEO
Go take it in my office.

Bartlet nods, takes a quick glance outside at Toby, and exits into Leo's office.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT
Josh, Donna, Ed and Larry are discussing the speech over cartons of Chinese food.

JOSH
See?

ED
Yeah.

JOSH
Larry?

LARRY
Yeah.

JOSH
See the problem?

ED
Well, they didn't bring the funny, Josh.

JOSH
No, they didn't. [to Donna] What are you doing?

DONNA
I'm jotting down some go-tos in case a joke doesn't work. "I haven't seen an audience 
this dead since..." That kind of thing.

JOSH
You think the President's gonna get heckled?

DONNA
No, but I've read the speech and I think you'd be wise to have some dead audience 
metaphors in your pocket.

JOSH
Okay, here we go. "Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very happy to be here. And I want to thank 
the White House Correspondents Association for inviting me. I expect I'll be stuck here 
tonight with my fair share of verbal harpoons. I don't mind, just don't stick me... 
[less enthusiasm with every word] with... the... dinner check." Wow.

DONNA
And then it says here, "Allow for laughter."

JOSH
Yeah, well, unless we give that instruction to the audience I don't think it's going to 
be a problem.

Sam and Ainsley enter.

SAM
Hey!

JOSH
"I don't mind, just don't stick me with the dinner check?"

SAM
I know, it's like he's playing Grossinger's.

DONNA
"I know some of you are troubled by my frequent use of Latin references. Well, all I can 
say is 'no te preocupus'."

LARRY
The joke there is that it's in Spanish.

ED
It's that kind of Latin.

DONNA
And that's probably where you'll want your first dead audience joke.

JOSH
We're not gonna need a dead audience joke.

AINSLEY
Donna, who gave you those beautiful flowers on your desk?

JOSH
I did. Me. Those are from me.

AINSLEY
What's the occasion?

DONNA
Nothing.

JOSH
Our anniversary.

DONNA
Our not anniversary.

JOSH
Donna doesn't like to talk about it.

DONNA
I really don't.

AINSLEY
Okay.

SAM 
[helpfully] A few years ago, Donna's boyfriend broke up with her so she started working 
for Josh. But then, the boyfriend told her to come back, and she did. And then they broke 
up, and she came back to work. 

Donna stares at him with an upset expression.

SAM
I thought you meant you didn't want to talk about it. [beat] I'm a spokesman -- it's 
in my blood.

AINSLEY
Well, they're nice flowers.

ED
"And I'd also like to thank our host, Bill Maher..."

SAM
We're not making fun of the host.

AINSLEY
Who are we making fun of?

SAM, JOSH, ED and LARRY
Republicans!

SAM
I only wish the Speaker were here tonight, but he's held up in negotiations on the Hill. 
He's demanding his latest pre-nup include a line item veto?

JOSH
There it is!

SAM
All right! Two groups. You guys over there, we'll stay over here.

AINSLEY
I want to be in the other group.

SAM
Why?

AINSLEY
The Kung Pao Chicken.

SAM
Get the Kung Pao Chicken and come back here. Let's go! In a half an hour I want to make 
Toby laugh.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - NIGHT
Leo brings a glass of bourbon out to Toby.

LEO
So I found out about a year ago. Two nights before the State of the Union, he had an 
attack.

TOBY
He did?

LEO
When he passed out in the Oval Office.

TOBY
That was an attack?

LEO
Yeah.

TOBY
I thought it was the flu.

LEO
It wasn't.

Leo goes back inside THE OVAL OFFICE. Toby follows.

TOBY
How is it possible? How is it possible that this was kept a secret? First of all, who 
else knows?

LEO
You're the 16th person.

TOBY
Who else?

LEO
I'll tell you some of them. I won't tell you all of them.

TOBY
Why not?

LEO
Because it's not entirely my business. I'm not sure of my footing here. The President 
will be off the phone in a minute, and in the meantime you'll take what I give you.

TOBY
It's not entirely your business?

LEO
The First Lady. The doctor, the radiologist, the specialist, the kids...

TOBY
Who else?

LEO
That's it, for now.

TOBY
He took a physical. Those doctors were from eight years ago. He took a physical...

LEO
It's in remission. It doesn't show up during a physical.

TOBY
Leo...

LEO
It's in remission. Nobody lied.

TOBY
Nobody lied?

LEO
Nobody.

TOBY
Nobody lied? Is that what you've been saying to yourself over and over again...

LEO
Look...

TOBY
...for a year, Leo? A deception of massive proportion? I can't even... He gets a 
physical twice a year at Bethesda. His doctors are Naval officers. Are you telling me 
that officers are involved in this?

LEO
Toby...

TOBY
These guys are going to be court-martialed.

LEO
Nobody... Listen to me. Nobody lied. Nobody was asked to lie.

TOBY
Coercion.

LEO
Nobody was asked to lie!

TOBY
Officers. The First Lady. Surgeons... Surgeon generals, for all I know...

BARTLET
[enters] The plural of surgeon general isn't surgeon generals, it's surgeons general. 
Like attorneys general, or courts martial. Nobody was asked to lie. That was Garreth from 
the FAA. Upon interrogating Reda Nessam, they believe it's possible that another rental 
car crossed the border yesterday. They believe it's headed to a safe house in Patterson, 
New Jersey, and the FBI thinks they can apprehend him in 24 hours. Of course, the only 
way all of this will happen is if Reda Nessam is telling the truth, so who wants odds? 
Anyway, they're still looking at forensic evidence and we're going to talk again in a 
few minutes to decide if there's a credible threat.

TOBY
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't hear that.

BARTLET
I said, we're going to decide if there's a credible threat. Why? What are you guys 
talking about?

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Josh exits the Roosevelt Room leaving the others inside. He heads down the hall to the 
OUTER OVAL OFFICE. He enters carrying a carton of Chinese take-out. Charlie is seated 
at his desk reading.
 
JOSH
Hey.
 
CHARLIE
How you doing?
 
JOSH
You have any idea how much longer Toby’s gonna be?
 
CHARLIE
I don’t.
 
JOSH
[clears his throat] Let me ask you... you think this joke’s funny? [perches on a desk] 
I’m sorry the Speaker isn’t here. He’s up on the Hill in last minute negotiations. 
He’s going over his prenup and he wants a line-item veto.
 
Charlie stops reading and look over his shoulder at Josh.
 
CHARLIE
Well, I think it’s pretty funny but....
 
JOSH
What?
 
CHARLIE
I wouldn’t do it.
 
JOSH
Why?
 
CHARLIE
I think it’s gonna call attention to the First Lady not being there.
 
JOSH
[mouth full of food] Where’s Mrs. Bartlet gonna be?
 
CHARLIE
She went back up to Manchester.
 
JOSH
[surprised] She’s not coming to the Correspondents' Dinner?
 
CHARLIE
Probably not.
 
JOSH
[confused] Charlie, what’s going on?
 
Charlie sternly looks over his shoulder at Josh.
 
JOSH
Sorry. [looks at the closed door to the Oval Office] All right. [throws away the food 
carton and gets up] You don’t know when Toby’s out?
 
CHARLIE
[glances at Josh] No.
 
JOSH
Okay. [exits]

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The crowd is still huddled around the table except for Sam.
 
JOSH
[enters] All right... Here we go!
 
Josh claps his hands together and he rounds the table. Sam enters reciting from a 
Law Book.
 
SAM
"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States 
or any state on account of sex."
 
Sam slams the book shut. Josh stands on the other side of the table next to Donna who is 
reading from a tablet.
 
JOSH
[confused] What’s the joke?
 
SAM
It’s not a joke. [sits]
 
AINSLEY
It’s the Equal Rights Amendment.
 
JOSH
When did that come back?
 
DONNA
Read what these guys have.
 
Donna hands Josh the tablet and goes back to her seat. Ainsley continues to ignore Sam 
as Josh reads.
 
SAM
Shall not be abridged or denied on account of sex. Very dangerous language. This must be 
stopped. What could possibly be your problem with the ERA?
 
AINSLEY
[smiles] It’s redundant.

JOSH
[confused] Why are we talking about the ERA?

SAM
She’s doing a thing.
 
JOSH
Yeah, but it's not back or anything though, is it? 
 
SAM
Certainly, not if Phyllis Schlafly here has her way.
 
AINSLEY
Look... [throws down her pencil and gets up]
 
SAM
It’s redundant?
 
AINSLEY
I’m a low maintenance lady. I’ve got the 14th Amendment. I’m fine!

She walks to the head of the table and grabs a beer.
 
SAM
How about...
 
Ainsley grabs some paper and heads back to her seat. Donna tries to hide a smile.
 
AINSLEY
The 14th Amendment which says that a citizen of the United States is anyone that’s 
born here... that's me... and that no citizen can be denied due process. I’m covered. 
Make a law for somebody else.

JOSH
Alright, here’s a joke based on the premise that the party afterwards is hard to get 
into and that the President is the Commander-In-Chief. "I hear the Bloomberg party is 
gonna be hard to get into this year but I’m not worried. I’m going to the party with 
the 82nd Airborne."
 
DONNA
And then the President says "Wow, I haven’t heard a room this quiet since we lost the 
signal on Galileo."
 
JOSH
Or "Wow, I haven’t seen my staff update their resumes this quickly since the last time 
I tanked at the Correspondents' Dinner!" 
 
DONNA
Josh.
 
JOSH
Yeah?
 
DONNA
[condescending] When you yell you make it harder for people to find the funny.
 
JOSH
Hey, who gave you those flowers on your desk?
 
DONNA
A mean man who can’t read a calendar.
 
JOSH
Sam. 

He motions for Sam to follow him to the corner.
 
SAM
We’re doing fine. Toby’s gonna come in here and nail it. This is his thing.
 
JOSH
Yeah, cut the Speaker joke, okay? Mrs. Bartlet might not be there.
 
SAM
Okay.
 
JOSH
Alright, so uh... we’re gonna be fine here.
 
SAM
No! We’re doing great! [to the rest] We’re doing great everybody, right?
 
LARRY
Sam, we’ve got one here but it involves a John Wayne impersonation and a sock puppet.
 
SAM
Yeah, we’re eating it.
 
CUT TO: INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Toby sits on the sofa. Bartlet sits across from him with a drink in his hand.
 
TOBY
Leo said you had an attack last year?
 
BARTLET
[looks up] Hmm?

TOBY
Leo said you had an attack last year. 
 
BARTLET
Yeah.
 
TOBY
A couple of nights before the State of the Union.
 
BARTLET
Yeah.
 
TOBY
Wasn’t that also the night you saw satellite pictures of India moving on Kashmir?
 
BARTLET
Yeah.
 
TOBY
India and Pakistan were staring each other down. Control of some nuclear weapons had 
been put in the field.
 
BARTLET
Yeah?
 
TOBY
So, in the middle of a... I don’t know what you call them...
 
BARTLET
An episode.
 
TOBY
...You were in the Situation Room as Commander-In-Chief.
 
BARTLET
[sarcastically] I know. I can’t believe we’re all still here.
 
Bartlet takes a drink and stares at Toby. 
 
TOBY
Mr.... 
 
BARTLET
The episode was over. Leo was with me. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was with me as 
were the Secretaries of State and Defense. 
 
TOBY
Do you receive medication?
 
BARTLET
I’m sorry?
 
TOBY
Do you receive medication?
 
BARTLET
I get injections of Betaseron.
 
TOBY
From whom?
 
BARTLET
From a doctor.
 
TOBY
None of your current doctors are aware of your condition... Mr. President, is your wife 
medicating you?
 
Leo enters.
 
BARTLET
I think it would be best while temperatures are running a little high that you refer to my 
wife as Mrs. Bartlet or the First Lady.
 
TOBY
[quietly] Yes, sir.
 
BARTLET
What you got, Leo?
 
Leo steps around the couch and hands Bartlet a folder.
 
LEO
They’d like a few more minutes.
 
BARTLET
The FAA?
 
LEO
Yeah.
 
Bartlet rises and they walk to his desk. 
 
BARTLET
Talk me through what heightened security means.
 
LEO
Well, they deploy more uniformed police and the dogs. They hand search luggage.
 
Toby sits on the couch deep in thought.
 
BARTLET
They discontinue...
 
LEO
Curbside checking. Eliminate the first two rows of short-term parking.
 
BARTLET
Okay, they want a few minutes?
 
LEO
Yeah.
 
BARTLET
[sarcastic] Toby’s concerned that the peaceful solution I brokered in Kashmir last year 
was the result of a drug-induced haze.
 
Toby looks at the President.
 
LEO
[to Toby] I was there with him. So was Fitz. So was Cashman, Hutchinson, Berryhill...
 
TOBY
Well, that’s fantastic.
 
LEO
Toby!
 
TOBY
None of you were elected!
 
BARTLET
I was elected, they were appointed. [points at Leo] The Vice President was elected. 
He has the constitutional authority to assume my...
 
TOBY
Not last May he didn’t. [rises] He didn’t last May when you were under general anesthesia.
 
BARTLET
That’s because I never signed the letter, but I don’t think I got shot because I got MS.
 
TOBY
I don’t think you did either, sir. I meant that during a night of extreme chaos and fear, 
when we didn’t yet know if we’d been the victims of domestic or-or foreign terrorism or 
even an act of war there was uncertainty as to who was giving the National Security 
orders and that was because you never signed a letter! 
 
Leo looks uncomfortable. The President glares at Toby.
 
TOBY
So I'm led to wonder, given your condition and it’s lack of predictability why there 
isn’t simply a signed letter sitting in a file someplace? And the answer, of course, is 
that... [laughs] if there was a-a signed letter sitting in a file someplace, somebody 
would ask why. 
 
Bartlet looks angrily at Leo.
 
TOBY
[angry] The Commander-In-Chief had just been attacked. He was under a general anesthetic. 
A fugitive was at large, the manhunt included every federal, state and local law 
enforcement agency. The Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware 
National Guard units were federalized! The KH-10 showed Republican Guard movement in 
southern Iraq. [yelling] And twelve hours earlier an F-117 was shot down in the no fly, 
and the Vice President’s authority was murky at best! 
 
Barely controlling his anger, Bartlet walks behind his desk.
 
TOBY
The National Security Advisor and Secretary of State didn’t know who they were taking 
their orders from! I wasn’t in the Situation Room that night but I’ll bet all the money 
in my pockets against all the money in your pockets that it was Leo... who no one elected! 
For 90 minutes that night there was a coup d’etat in this country. 
 
Bartlet stands furious. Leo looks at Toby.
 
BARTLET
And the walls came tumbling down. I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.
 
LEO
Sir...
 
BARTLET
[angry] No, Leo. Toby’s concern for my health is moving me in ways...
 
TOBY
Mr. President....
 
Bartlet furiously throws the folder across his desk.
 
BARTLET
[yelling] SHUT UP!
 
Bartlet stalks back around the desk and faces Toby.
 
BARTLET
[condescending] You know your indignation would be a lot more interesting to me if it 
weren’t quite so covered in crap! 
 
Charlie stands in the doorway.
 
CHARLIE
Sir...
 
BARTLET
[while glaring at Toby] Yeah.
 
CHARLIE
Mr. Garreth.
 
BARTLET
[acknowledges Charlie] Thanks.
 
Charlie quietly closes the door behind him. 
 
BARTLET
[angry] Are you pissed because I didn’t say anything or are you pissed because there 
were 15 people who knew before you did? I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.
 
Bartlet walks to the other side of the room. Leo, standing between them, stares in shock. 
He puts his hand to his forehead. Toby stands quietly looking at nothing.
 
LEO
[to Bartlet] Take the call in here. 
 
Bartlet nods.
 
LEO
[to Toby] We’ll step outside for a minute.
 
Leo motions to the door. Bartlet glares at Toby. Toby looks at him quickly before 
following Leo out. Bartlet walks back over to the couches and collects himself for 
a moment. He then picks up the phone.
 
BARTLET
[into phone] Yeah, this is the President.
 
FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT
Sam, Donna, Josh, Ainsley, Larry and Ed are sitting at the large table and are huddled 
around an easel, brainstorming ideas for the speech.

SAM
Self-deprecation.

ED
Yes.

SAM
Self-deprecation is what we need.

LARRY
Yes.

SAM
Self-deprecation is the appetizer of charm.

ED
We need jokes about the staff.

SAM
We need jokes about the staff.

AINSLEY
[to Sam] Let’s start with you.

SAM
Problem is there aren’t many jokes you can make about me.

DONNA
How about this. Um, "Knock knock." "Who’s there?" "Sam and his prostitute friend."

Ainsley, Ed and Larry laugh.

SAM
See, I think that was a bit of misdirected anger there.

DONNA
I’m okay with that.

SAM
Well, in that case, Ainsley, you know why I got you flowers in April instead of February? 
'Cause you ditched me the first time around to go back to the guy who ditched you the 
first time around only to have him ditch you the second time around.

Donna smacks Josh upside the back of the head.

JOSH
Ow! What the hell? That was him!

DONNA
He was being you!

JOSH
Well, in fairness, I think everybody should have a turn. Sam, is there anything we can 
pull, anything funny we can recycle?

SAM
Yeah, pull something I wrote from October called "Government-wide Accountability for 
Merit System Principles."

JOSH
That one was a barn-burner, was it?

Josh stands up from the table, groaning, and exits the room to find the old speech.

DONNA
[to Sam] Do you have any idea how much grief I took from him when I came back?

SAM
How much?

DONNA
None. I walked in the door. He said, "Thank God. There's a pile of stuff on the desk." 
This is his way. He's just going to snark me every April. Prince of passive-aggressive 
behavior.

SAM
What does "snark" mean?

DONNA
I don’t know, but he’s doing it.

SAM
There any coffee left?

ED
In the mess.

SAM
Anybody want anything?

AINSLEY
Do you think they have cheesecake down there?

SAM
[looks at his watch] It’s quarter after midnight. The pastry chef usually stays on 
till dawn.

AINSLEY
I’ll go see if there is.

Sam and Ainsley leave together out to the HALLWAY.

SAM
You know, we should make a joke about women, 'cause there's no law against that or paying 
them less money than men.

AINSLEY
Well, there is a law against that. It’s the Pay Equity Act. It's passed in 1964, when 
women were making 59 cents to the dollar.

SAM
What are you making now?

AINSLEY
79 cents.

SAM
So, everything's fine.

AINSLEY
No, there are still some problems. But I’m not worried ‘cause the federal government’s 
coming to the rescue.

SAM
Look...

AINSLEY
You think pay disparity is ‘cause some sexist in human resources hired two people for 
equal positions and paid the man more?

SAM
Oftentimes...

AINSLEY
And oftentimes women make less money over the course of their lifetimes because they 
choose to.

SAM
Oh, goodnight nurse! They don't choose to make less money. They're financially punished 
for having kids.

AINSLEY
They made a choice to have kids.

SAM
Well, not necessarily if you guys have your way, but that's a different can of tuna.
[beat] I flat-out guarantee you that if men were biologically responsible for 
procreation, there'd be paid family leave in every Fortune 500.

AINSLEY
Sam, if men were biologically responsible for procreation, they'd fall down and die at 
the first sonogram.

Sam and Ainsley walk into THE MESS. Sam checks out the coffee maker while Ainsley gathers 
up cups and saucers.

SAM
If the Amendment’s redundant, then what's your problem if it’s passed or not?

AINSLEY
Because I’m a Republican! Have we met? I believe that every time the federal government 
hands down a new law, it leaves for the rest of us a little less freedom. So I say, 
let’s just stick to the ones we absolutely need in order to have water come out of the 
faucet and our cars not stolen. That is my problem with passing a redundant law. 
[stands next to Sam with a full tray] Sam? 

SAM
Yeah?

AINSLEY
The all-night pastry chef? You were just kidding about that, right?

SAM
Yeah.

Ainsley shoves the tray at Sam and walks toward the exit.

CUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - NIGHT
Toby sits on a bench with his head in his hand. Leo walks slowly toward him from the 
direction of the residence. Toby looks up as Leo approaches.

LEO
He’s still on the phone with State in the Residence.

Leo looks across the White House grounds as thunder rumbles in the distance.

TOBY
So Hoynes knows?

LEO
Hmm?

TOBY
Hoynes is one of the 16?

LEO
Yeah.

TOBY
And he thinks the President won’t run again?

LEO
He thinks there’s a chance.

TOBY
Will he?

LEO
[sits] Will the President run?

TOBY
Where’s the First Lady?

LEO
In Manchester.

TOBY
Why’d she come to me after the State of the Union?

LEO
Toby...

Leo looks at Toby, looks away, shakes his head, looks back at him.

TOBY
Why’s she mad at the President? It’s because the State of the Union set up the 
re-election run and somehow she’s under the impression that’s not supposed to happen.

LEO
The First Lady...

TOBY
I have no kind of investigative mind. Zero. It took me six days and 23 minutes to 
figure it out.

LEO
He’ll run.

TOBY
Yeah, yeah ‘cause we stood in that office a couple of months ago, you and I, and you 
said, "Take my hand," and we just...

Leo bows his head and nods. Toby looks drained and puts his hand to his head again.

TOBY
Never mind.

LEO
He’ll run.

TOBY
Hoynes was fourteen. Who was fifteen?

LEO
Dr. David Lee. The anesthesiologist at GW. He had to know about the Betaseron. 
Getting back to Hoynes...

TOBY
I’m sorry, Leo, but I need you to look at me right now and tell me the doctor’s not 
under some kind of surveillance.

LEO
The doctor’s free to talk to whomever he likes.

TOBY
Well, I’m sure we’re gonna find that out soon enough.

LEO
He’s not gonna leak it.

TOBY
Someone will.

LEO
Toby...

TOBY
Leo, Hoynes left bread crumbs. He wanted me to find out. A camping trip to Killington?

LEO
That was a jackass move.

TOBY
I don’t think it was. I think he may be the only one around here who’s acting responsibly.

LEO
To who?

TOBY
The Democratic Party. Seven and a half months to the Iowa caucus, and no one's been told 
the President might not be the nominee!

LEO
He’s gonna run!

TOBY
No, he may not have that option, Leo.

LEO
When this story breaks, it’ll be because we broke it, and we'll control it. And the 
public will accept it. It’s not like it’s unprecedented that a President conceal health 
issues. [beat] What do you think is gonna happen? I mean it. What do you think is going 
to happen?

TOBY
[clears his throat, stands up and faces Leo] Well, I suppose one of five things. 
The President can decide not to run. He can run and not win. He can run and win.

LEO
And? What are the other two?

TOBY
Leo...

LEO
You think he’s gonna need to resign?

TOBY
There’s gonna be hearing upon hearing upon hearing.

LEO
He hasn't broken a law.

The door to the Oval Office opens. Leo stands up as Charlie steps outside.

CHARLIE
The President’s on his way back.

LEO
Thanks.

Charlie goes back inside and shuts the door.

TOBY
Says you. [beat] You don't have to break the law to get served with articles of 
impeachment.

LEO
Toby, it is never gonna get that far.

TOBY
[chuckles softly] Write down the exact date and time you said that.

Toby goes back inside. Leo stares straight ahead watching him go.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT

DONNA
[to Larry and Ed] "See, the thing about me, is that mine is a dry wit. And a dry wit, 
like a fine martini, is best enjoyed..."

LARRY
Uh-oh...

DONNA
Yeah, nowhere to go there.

Sam and Ainsley walk into the room. Sam is carrying the tray of coffee.

ED
[to Sam] What the hell took so long?

SAM
We got the coffee but then I spilled it coming up the stairs, you know, the first 
couple of times. Where’s Josh?

DONNA
You sent him to get the thing.

SAM
For how long? I’ve had time to spill coffee, you know, a lot.

DONNA
I’ll find him.

Donna stands up and leaves to find Josh.

SAM
So, guys...

ED
Yeah?

SAM
When I was downstairs, I made a decision. I’m gonna register with the Republican Party, 
and I’ll tell you why, if you’re curious. It’s because they’re a freedom-loving people.

AINSLEY
We also like beef.

SAM
You know, you insist government is depraved for not legislating against what we can see 
on the newsstands, or what we can see in an art exhibit, or what we can burn in protest, 
or which sex we’re allowed to have sex with, or a woman’s right to choose, but don't you 
dare try to regulate this deadly weapon I have concealed on me, for that would encroach 
against my freedom.

AINSLEY
Yeah? And Democrats believe in free speech as long as it isn’t prayer while you're 
standing in school. You believe in the Freedom of Information Act except if you want to 
find out if your 14-year-old daughter’s had an abortion...

SAM
We believe in the ERA.

AINSLEY
Well, go get ‘em.

SAM
How can you have an objection to something that says...?

AINSLEY
Because it’s humiliating! A new amendment we vote on, declaring that I am equal under 
the law to a man. I am mortified to discover there’s reason to believe I wasn’t before. 
I am a citizen of this country. I am not a special subset in need of your protection. 
I do not have to have to have my rights handed down to me by a bunch of old, white men. 
The same Article 14 that protects you, protects me. And I went to law school just to 
make sure. And with that, I’m going back down to the mess, because I thought I may have 
seen, there, a peach. [leaves]

SAM
[to Larry and Ed] I could've countered that, but I’d already moved on to other things 
in my head.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Donna walks down the hall and stops in the doorway to Josh’s office. Josh is standing 
precariously on a chair trying to reach the top shelf of his very overloaded bookcase.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Oh!

Numerous books and binders cascade to the floor.

JOSH
Well, that was predictable.

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
I’m trying to find that speech Sam said.

Josh steps down, kneels on floor and starts picking up the mess he’s made.

DONNA
You know, we keep them on computer.

JOSH
Well, yeah, sure, I suppose.

DONNA
Except you don’t know how to use a computer.

Donna kneels down on the floor facing Josh and helps him clean up.

JOSH
Right.

DONNA
Ah, Josh, Josh, Josh.

JOSH
Yes?

DONNA
Joshua, Josh, Josh.

JOSH
What the hell is happening now?

DONNA
You feel, I believe, because you’re quite addle-minded, that this job was my second 
choice.

JOSH
Hey, I’m just grateful we were your last choice.

DONNA
I’m gonna give you a little gift right now, which you don’t deserve.

JOSH
Donna, if you’ve got your old Catholic-school uniform on under there, don’t get me 
wrong, I applaud the thought, but...

DONNA
Okay, what I need is for you to stop being like, you, for a second.

JOSH
Okay.

DONNA
When I came back, you remember I had a bandage on my ankle?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
I told you I slipped on the ice on the front walk?

JOSH
Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you didn’t put down the kitty litter.

DONNA
I was actually in a car accident.

JOSH
You were in a car accident?

DONNA
It was...

JOSH
Seriously, you were in an accident?

DONNA
It was no big deal.

JOSH
You told me it was a late thaw.

DONNA
[smiles] Yes. I did. Anyway, they took me to the hospital and I called him and he 
came down to get me and on the way he stopped and met some friends of his for a beer.

JOSH
[incredulously] He stopped on the way to the hospital for a beer?

DONNA
Yes. And that’s why I left him. Which was the point of my telling you this. I left him. 
So stop remembering that. What I remember is that you took me back when you had 
absolutely no reason to trust me again, and you didn’t make fun of me or him, and 
you had every reason to.

JOSH
Donna...

DONNA
You’re gonna make fun of him now, aren’t you?

JOSH
No.

DONNA
‘Cause that’s why I didn’t tell you in the first place.

JOSH
I’m not gonna make fun of him.

DONNA
Good.

JOSH
But just what kind of a dumbkes were you...

DONNA
He was supposed to meet some of his friends. He stopped on the way to tell them that 
he couldn’t.

JOSH
And had a beer?

DONNA
Does this make you feel superior?

Josh looks away and starts to say something, but doesn’t.

DONNA
Yes, you are better than my old boyfriend.

Josh stands up and walks toward the door, but stops in the doorway.

JOSH
I’m just sayin’ if you were in an accident, I wouldn’t stop for a beer.

DONNA
[stands up] If you were in an accident, I wouldn’t stop for red lights. Thanks for 
taking me back. [walks out of his office] Oh, and the flowers are beautiful.

Josh stands in the doorway staring after her.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo and Toby sit silently facing each other.

TOBY
Why not heighten security?

LEO
Hmm?

TOBY
At the airports. Why not heighten security? What’s the downside?

Leo and Toby stand as Bartlet enters from the veranda.

BARTLET
[leaning on a wing chair] Sorry about that.

LEO
What’s going on?

BARTLET
Charlie! [to Leo] I’ve got to make the call.

CHARLIE
[enters] Yes, sir?

BARTLET
Let’s get Garreth back.

Charlie nods and closes the door. Bartlet sighs and glances at Toby. Toby meets his gaze, 
then looks away. Bartlet checks his watch. Leo senses the tension, looks at Toby, then 
looks at Bartlet.

LEO
Toby was just asking what the downside of going to a security condition was.

BARTLET
The scanners they use take an hour to search the luggage of 250 passengers. The condition 
requires two photo IDs. Most people only have one. Delays. Delays are the downside.

CHARLIE
[knocks] Mr. Garreth.

BARTLET 
That timed out well.

Bartlet sits down in the chair and picks up the phone. Leo and Toby sit on the sofas.

BARTLET
[into phone] Hal? Okay, let's do it. I’m ordering the airports to a 2-condition. You’ll 
have it in writing in about five minutes. Thanks. [hangs up, to Leo] I didn't know enough.

TOBY
I know the feeling.

BARTLET 
[calmly] I have no intention of apologizing to you, Toby.

TOBY
Would you mind if I ask why not?

BARTLET
‘Cause you’re not the one with MS, a wife, three kids and airports to close. Not every 
part of me belongs to you. This was personal. I’m not willing to relinquish that right.

Bartlet stands up, walks over behind his desk. Leo and Toby stand.

TOBY
It will appear to many, if not most, as fraud. It will appear as if you denied the voters 
an opportunity to decide for themselves. They’re generally not willing to relinquish that 
right, either.

Bartlet and Leo silently and solemnly look at each other, absorbing Toby's words. 
The clock ticks softly in the background.

BARTLET
Yeah.

TOBY
Mr. President, at some point in the near future, we’re going to have to speak to some 
lawyers.

BARTLET 
Well, that’s what usually brings on the episodes, but if you say so.

TOBY
[laughs quietly and icily to himself] It's 17 people, by the way.

BARTLET 
I'm sorry?

TOBY
You knew. We weren’t counting you. It’s 17 people.

Bartlet looks at Leo, who looks pained. Bartlet removes his glasses, puts them down on 
his desk and sighs wearily.

BARTLET
I don’t know. [shakes his head slowly] It may have been unbelievably stupid. It may have 
been unthinkably stupid. I don’t know. 

Toby meets Bartlet's gaze.

BARTLET
I’m sorry. I really am.

Leo is stunned. Toby shifts a bit from side to side. They are all silent for several 
moments.

TOBY
I’ve gotta go in the other room and uh...

BARTLET
Yeah. I’ll see you tomorrow. Thanks.

TOBY
Thank you, Mr. President.

Toby leaves the Oval Office but does not close the door behind him. He pauses briefly in 
the foyer, then proceeds a few steps across the hall to THE ROOSEVELT ROOM and opens the 
door. Voices and laughter envelope Toby as he enters the room and sits down at the table. 

JOSH [OS]
That was... I think that’s a good one.

There is general good-humored disagreement with Josh.

SAM [OS]
Toby!

DONNA [OS]
Toby!

JOSH [OS]
We’re dying here, what do you got?

ED [OS]
Um, okay. So, the President was asked to pick tonight’s menu and he says, "Oh, just 
serve anything you want except lame duck."

LARRY [OS]
Toby, listen, listen to this.

TOBY
[weakly] Okay.

LARRY [OS]
So the President says, "I know times are tough. The NASDAQ just filed for not-for-profit 
status."

SAM [OS]
Toby.

Sam tosses Toby his ball, which he catches. Toby looks pained, but continues to listen 
to joke suggestions.

AINSLEY [OS]
Okay, what about the one about the Pentagon?

Over Toby’s shoulder, framed by the French doors of the Roosevelt Room, Bartlet signs a 
document as Charlie looks on. Leo steps into view, with a stern look on his face, and 
closes the door to the Oval Office.

JOSH [OS]
Okay, uh, you have to try and imagine that the President is saying it. Tell me if you 
think this is funny.

A single sound echoes the opening rhythm of Toby bouncing his ball against the wall.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
